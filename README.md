# Benchmarking-of-small-RNA-seq
Analysis workflow for benchmarking of small RNA-seq library preparation protocols

**Samples**   
Raw fastq files are available for download at Gene Expression Omnibus with accession [GSE149513](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149513). 

**Workflow**   
Initial trimming and mapping was done with bash scripts. The counting and analysis with figure generation were done with R scripts.
Whole workflow expects samples downloaded from GEO. Some of R scripts expect files which generation is not included in the workflow. Such files are uploaded here in "src" folder.
